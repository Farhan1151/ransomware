This is simple ransomware that will encrypt all the files on your drive. For testing purposes, I have excluded the C: and D: drives from the encryption process so that your Windows system files and other data on the D: drive remain unaffected.

You could easily disguise this file as antivirus software and send it to someone. If the user runs it, it will encrypt all their files.

I have included a warning prompt about the encryption for educational purposes only. If I wanted to create a realistic-looking antivirus interface, you would never be able to trace it back to me.
